# Reinforcement Learning Module — PPO Agent for Robotic Control

This folder contains the reinforcement learning (RL) implementation for the **Intelligent 6-DOF Robotic Defense & Rescue System**. The PPO agent is trained to control the Niryo One robotic arm for tasks like tracking and interacting with a moving drone within a simulated environment.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch  
- Stable-Baselines3  
- Gym  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

ls -la
🚀 Usage Instructions
Follow these steps to run the simulation and train the RL agent:

Start CoppeliaSim and import the Niryo One robotic arm into the environment.

Check the Niryo One API to ensure it is running properly.

Import the quadcopter (drone) into the simulation environment.

Install dependencies in your VS Code environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the simulation in CoppeliaSim.

Simulate drone movement by executing:

bash
Copy code
python drone_moving/drone_moving.py
The drone will start moving in the environment.

Train the PPO agent controlling the Niryo One arm:

bash
Copy code
python training_script/train.py
(Optional) Visualize object detection using the drone camera:

bash
Copy code
python drone_detection/drone_detection.py
📌 Notes
envs/env.py defines the custom observation and action space for the RL environment.

inference/inference.py can be used to run the trained PPO model for testing or evaluation.

Ensure the CoppeliaSim simulation is running before executing any Python scripts.

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate real-time sensor input from the physical robot.

Add safety constraints and collision avoidance.

Sim-to-real transfer for deploying the trained RL agent on the physical Niryo One arm.

If you want, I can also create a **shorter, polished version** for your **root repository README** that links to this module and looks professional for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that next?
