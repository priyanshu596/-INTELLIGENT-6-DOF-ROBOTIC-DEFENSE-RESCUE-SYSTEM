Got it! Letâ€™s make it **fully clean, properly formatted, and copy-paste ready** for GitHub without any markdown errors or extra escape characters. Hereâ€™s the corrected `README.md` for your `R.L implementation` folder:

# Reinforcement Learning Module â€” PPO Agent for Robotic Control

This folder contains the reinforcement learning (RL) implementation for the **Intelligent 6-DOF Robotic Defense & Rescue System**. The PPO agent is trained to control the Niryo One robotic arm for tasks like tracking and interacting with a moving drone within a simulated environment.

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

1. **Start CoppeliaSim** and import the Niryo One robotic arm into the environment.
2. **Check the Niryo One API** to ensure it is running properly.
3. **Import the quadcopter (drone)** into the simulation environment.
4. **Install dependencies** in your VS Code environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Start the simulation** in CoppeliaSim.
6. **Simulate drone movement**:

```bash
python drone_moving/drone_moving.py
```

7. **Train the PPO agent** controlling the Niryo One arm:

```bash
python training_script/train.py
```

8. **(Optional) Visualize object detection** using the drone camera:

```bash
python drone_detection/drone_detection.py
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

* `envs/env.py` defines the custom observation and action space for the RL environment.
* `inference/inference.py` can be used to run the trained PPO model for testing or evaluation.
* Make sure the CoppeliaSim simulation is running before executing any Python scripts.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time sensor input from the physical robot.
* Add safety constraints and collision avoidance.
* Sim-to-real transfer for deploying the trained RL agent on the physical Niryo One arm.
