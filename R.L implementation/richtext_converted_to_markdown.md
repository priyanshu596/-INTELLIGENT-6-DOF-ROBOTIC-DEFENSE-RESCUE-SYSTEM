Got it! I’ve cleaned up your README content, removed all unnecessary escapes and formatting errors, and structured it properly so it’s **ready to copy-paste directly into GitHub**.

# Reinforcement Learning Module — PPO Agent for Robotic Control

This folder contains the reinforcement learning (RL) implementation for the **Intelligent 6-DOF Robotic Defense & Rescue System**. The PPO agent is trained to control the Niryo One robotic arm for tasks like tracking and interacting with a moving drone within a simulated environment.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch  
- Stable-Baselines3  
- Gym  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

Install dependencies:

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to run the simulation and train the RL agent:

1. **Start CoppeliaSim** and import the Niryo One robotic arm into the environment.
2. **Check the Niryo One API** to ensure it is running properly.
3. **Import the quadcopter (drone)** into the simulation environment.
4. **Install dependencies** in your VS Code environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Start the simulation** in CoppeliaSim.
6. **Simulate drone movement**:

```bash
python drone_moving/drone_moving.py
```

The drone will start moving in the environment.

7. **Train the PPO agent** controlling the Niryo One arm:

```bash
python training_script/train.py
```

8. **(Optional) Visualize object detection** using the drone camera:

```bash
python drone_detection/drone_detection.py
```

## 📌 Notes

* `envs/env.py` defines the custom observation and action space for the RL environment.
* `inference/inference.py` can be used to run the trained PPO model for testing or evaluation.
* Ensure the CoppeliaSim simulation is running before executing any Python scripts.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Integrate real-time sensor input from the physical robot.
* Add safety constraints and collision avoidance.
* Sim-to-real transfer for deploying the trained RL agent on the physical Niryo One arm.

If you want, I can also **create a polished root README** for your **entire repository**, linking this RL module, drone detection, and Niryo One setup, so your GitHub repo looks professional and complete.  

Do you want me to do that next?
