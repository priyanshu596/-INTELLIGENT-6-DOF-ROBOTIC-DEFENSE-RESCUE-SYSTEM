# INTELLIGENT-6-DOF-ROBOTIC-DEFENSE-RESCUE-SYSTEM
Intelligent 6-DOF robotic defense &amp; rescue system using Niryo One, RL, and VLLMs for drone tracking, search &amp; rescue, and autonomous medical assistance.

Got it ✅

So for your **main README**, instead of repeating RL usage instructions, you want it to:

* Act as a **project overview**
* Explain the **idea, motivation, innovation, uniqueness, architecture, impact**
* Serve as a **high-level entry point** to your repo (while the `R.L implementation` README is more technical).

Here’s a polished **main `README.md`** that you can copy-paste directly:

# 🛡️ Intelligent 6-DOF Robotic Defense & Rescue System

This repository contains the source code, reinforcement learning modules, and supporting documentation for the **Intelligent 6-DOF Robotic Defense & Rescue System** developed for **Smart India Hackathon 2025** under the theme *Robotics and Drones*.  

Our system integrates **robotics, reinforcement learning, and computer vision** to create a **multi-modal platform** capable of **defense monitoring, disaster response, and autonomous medical assistance**.

## 🌟 Core Idea

Modern emergencies demand fast, intelligent, and safe responses. Human-only intervention is risky and often delayed.  
This project aims to fill that gap with a **robotic system** that combines:  

- **Defense & Perimeter Monitoring**: Drone tracking and object detection.  
- **Search & Rescue**: Gesture and voice-based supervision for field deployment.  
- **Medical Assistance**: Autonomous delivery of essential supplies in rural and disaster-hit areas.  

---

## 💡 Key Innovations

- **3-in-1 Solution** → Medical Aid + Search & Rescue + Perimeter Monitoring.  
- **Hybrid Control** → Fully autonomous execution with optional human supervision.  
- **RL + Vision-Language Models** → Natural language task processing and safe task decomposition.  
- **Scalable Hardware** → Niryo One robotic arm with modular NEMA-17 extensions.  
- **Connectivity** → WiFi + LoRa (LoRaWAN) for last-mile communication.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Hardware Layer**  
   - Niryo One 6-DOF robotic arm  
   - Quadcopter drone for aerial operations  
   - Sensors for vision and environment awareness  

2. **AI Layer**  
   - PPO-based RL agent for robotic control  
   - Object detection using computer vision  
   - Vision-Language Models (VLLM) for natural command processing  

3. **Control & Safety Layer**  
   - Supervisor state machine keeps LLMs out of safety-critical control loops  
   - Monitored stop, velocity caps, and collision checks  

4. **Connectivity Layer**  
   - WiFi for local high-speed operations  
   - LoRa for rural/remote communication and disaster scenarios
